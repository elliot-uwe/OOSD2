# UWE Accommodation Management System

The UWE Accommodation Management System is designed to facilitate the allocation and rental process of student accommodation within the Student Village on the Frenchay Campus in Bristol. This system aims to streamline the process of allocating rooms, managing rentals, and monitoring the maintenance and cleanliness of individual accommodations.

## Overview

The main responsibility of the UWE accommodation team is to provide assistance to registered students who require on-campus housing. This system assists in the allocation and rental of accommodation, primarily within the Student Village, which comprises four halls of residence: Brecon, Cotswold, Mendip, and Quantock.

## Features

- **Accommodation Allocation:** The system facilitates the allocation of standard and superior en-suite accommodations to individual students based on their preferences and availability.
- **Rental Management:** It manages the rental process, including pricing, agreements, and duration. Standard en-suite accommodation is priced at £700 per month, while superior en-suite accommodation is priced at £750 per month. Rentals are typically for the entire 12-month academic year, from September to August.
- **Maintenance Tracking:** Hall Managers oversee the maintenance of accommodations within their respective halls. They can mark accommodations as "offline" when maintenance is required, ensuring they are not available for rental until the issues are resolved.
- **Cleaning Supervision:** The system aids in monitoring the cleanliness of individual accommodations, ensuring that they meet the required standards set by the university.

## Future Expansion

While initially focused on managing accommodations within the Student Village, the system is designed to be scalable. Following a successful trial run, the UWE accommodation team plans to expand its coverage to include all university accommodations in the future.

## Usage

The system is primarily accessed and managed by the UWE accommodation team and Hall Managers. It provides a user-friendly interface for:
- Allocating accommodations to students
- Managing rental agreements
- Tracking maintenance requests
- Monitoring cleanliness standards

## Technologies Used

The UWE Accommodation Management System is built using modern object oriented paradimes, with Java and JavaFX.

## Feedback and Contributions

We welcome feedback and contributions from the UWE community to improve the system and enhance the accommodation experience for our students.
